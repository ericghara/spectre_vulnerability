# Spectre Vulnerability
I took a deep dive reading about this vulnerability and ended up discovering a [great lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/System/Spectre_Attack/) describing the exploit.  This demo shows how even in a sandboxed environment, an intraprocess memory read outside of the sandbox is possible.  This attack was tuned for an Intel Haswell CPU on a 5.15.59 kernel.  

_Update:_ This style attack was totally ineffective against an AMD Ryzen 5700 on a 5.15.80 kernel.

## Compile
`gcc -march=native -o SpectreAttack SpectreAttack.c`
