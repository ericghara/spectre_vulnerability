# spectre_vulnerability
I took a deep dive reading about this vulnerability and ended up discovering a great lab to implement the exploit.  This demo shows how even in a sandboxed environment, an intraprocess memory read outside of the sandbox is possible.  The attack was tuned for an Intel Haswell cpu on a 5.15.59 kernel (Aug 2022 release), with all Spectre v1 mitigations enabled.
