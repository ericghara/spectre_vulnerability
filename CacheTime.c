/*
 * This script is useful for tuning the Spectre attack.
 * An array is created and then flushed from CPU cache.  Subsequently
 * 2 elements from the array (3*4096 and 7*4096) are read.  The access
 * time to array elements is then determined.  Since two elements
 * in the array were recently accessed, they should still be cached
 * and the time to access them will be significantly less than other elements
 * that need to be pulled from memory.  We can use the cache times to set a
 * threshold time to categorize a cache hit vs a cache miss.
 *
 * Note: The spacing of 4096 between each element read is to purposely
 * exceed the size of a cache page (~64 bytes).  This is important
 * because reading element 0, is likely to cause element 1 to be cached,
 * but very unlikely to cause element 4096 to be cached.
